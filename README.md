# weather-app
Brushing up on Node/Javascript skills by developing a weather application along side of learnings.

It is a simple application that showcases Node's asynchronous api behavior.  Currently running on command line and will eventually turn it into a application server paired with a React or Angular front end.

If you want to run this application at this time, all you need is the latest version of Node, download the repo, and run the main app.js.

eg. node app.js 'insert location' * (please use quotes for multiple word argument)
